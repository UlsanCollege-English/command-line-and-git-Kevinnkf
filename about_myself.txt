Hi! My name is Kevin Khalfani Fadillah, You can call me kevin or kev. I am a 5th semester student at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta (State Polytechnic of Jakarta) I took Informatics Engineering as my major at my home university.

I sign up for the IISMA (International Indonesian Student Mobility Awards) scholarship and choose Ulsan College as my host university this semester. I don't really have a choice about why i choose Global ICT as my major because of my home university policies so that it's easier to convert my grades when i got back to indonesia. But i choose South Korea because i have interest in their K-Pop culture and K-Drama.

I don't have a specific interest or any hobbies, i kind of enjoy most of the thing and hate it at the same time, but for now i think martial arts is my primary interest.
